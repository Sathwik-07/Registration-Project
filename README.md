# Welcome to my Project! 

I have developed the user inteface by blending HTML and CSS  providing the users to easily input their details into the registration form . I utilized Java Servlets to capture the  registration form data and integrated  with  JDBC Connection within the servlets. This integration allowed me for the efficient transmission of the registration form data to the database, ensuring a smooth insertion process.
