# Welcome to my Project! 

I developed the user inteface by blending HTML and CSS  providing the users to easily input their details into the registration form . I utilized Java Servlets to capture the  registration form data and integrated  with  JDBC Connection within the servlets. This integration allowed me for the efficient transmission of the registration form data to the database, ensuring a smooth insertion process.

 # Additional Details of this Project:

## a. One-Tier Architecture:
I followed  one-tier architecture, also known as the single-tier architecture, which  involves deploying all the application components (presentation, application logic, and data management) on a single machine. In this case, the Java Servlets, handling both presentation and application logic, are directly connected to the MySQL database.


## b. Integrated Development Environment :
Eclipse IDE is used for development. 

## c. MySQL Connector:

MySQL Connector/J is an external JAR (Java Archive) file that serves as the official JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver for MySQL. This connector allows  this application to connect and interact with the MySQL database.

## d. Web Server:

Apache Tomcat Server version 9.0 is used to host and deploy this Project. Tomcat is responsible for serving the web application and managing the servlets, JSP pages, and other resources.

Overall, these technologies, along with the one-tier architecture, Eclipse IDE, MySQL Connector/J, and Apache Tomcat Server version 9.0, form the backbone of this project  enabling its functionality and user interface.
